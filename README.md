Outside contributors: do NOT contribute here.

Organization members:
- Feel free to directly push to the `master` branch.
- Use txt or markdown for texts, use third-party websites and put URLs here for other things like tables or graphics.
- Avoid uploading files that require dedicated software to read (eg, .docx, .psd). Prefer formats that can be read on the web (eg, Google Docs).
